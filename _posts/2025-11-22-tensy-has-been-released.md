It has been a long journey to get here, but I finally feel the game is in a state where I feel comfortable making a public release. Tensy is a puzzle game where you select numbers to make them add up to ten. There are multiple game modes, different board sizes, local leaderboards, detailed statistics and more.

The game is very widely cross-platform and available on the following platforms:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Web (playable in browser)
- Android
- Haiku OS
- PlayStation Vita (homebrew)

(Note some platforms have not been fully tested on real hardware, such as the Windows ARM, macOS, Haiku OS and PlayStation Vita versions. Please take this into consideration before purchasing if you wish to play on those platforms.)

The minimum price to buy the game on itch.io is $5. However the web version is free to play both on the website and on itch.io, and the source code is [still available on GitHub](https://github.com/rollerozxa/tensy) under a GPLv3 if you want to build from source for free on your preferred platform. But I would still appreciate your financial support if you enjoy the game.

Even though this is the 1.0 release, I still plan to likely continue working on Tensy for a while, even beyond the likely inevitable 1.0.1 release. Stay tuned for more updates in the future!
