title: Tensy 1.0.1 released
---

Tensy 1.0.1 has just been released. It is primarily a patch release to fix and improve some things after the initial release, about a week's worth of changes collected up into an update.

<!--more-->

You can find the new version for download on itch.io now:

{% include itch-button.html %}

In addition to this Tensy should hopefully be appearing on F-Droid soon, giving you a convenient (as well as free) way of installing Tensy on Android. It's only fair, considering the game is GPLv3 licensed and suitable for inclusion in F-Droid's main repository.

## Changelog

- 32-bit Windows build should now work on Windows XP
- Fix shuffle amount not being unlimited in the leisure game mode
- Rework music playback system (music will now actually stop if muted)
- Add a little secret in the about screen
- New method of activating a certain easter egg for devices without keyboards
- Preparations for F-Droid release
- More minor bug fixes and improvements

And probably more stuff I forgot... You can view the full commit history [here](https://github.com/rollerozxa/tensy/commits/1.0.1).
